# LGMVIP-Web-Task-01

The LGMVIP-Web-Task-04 repository on GitHub contains the source code for a Scientific Calculator web application. This project was completed as part of the Let's Grow More Virtual Internship Program (LGMVIP). The repository houses the code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional scientific calculator.

## Scientific Calculator

The Scientific Calculator is designed to provide users with a range of mathematical and scientific operations, making it a versatile tool for performing complex calculations. It features a user-friendly interface with a display screen where users can input their mathematical expressions and view the results.

The calculator includes standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it offers advanced scientific functions such as square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, percentage calculations, and more.

The repository is well-organized, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, making it easy for developers to understand and modify the code as needed. The code is written in a simple and concise manner, ensuring that it is easily maintainable and scalable.

Users can access the Scientific Calculator web application by opening the provided HTML file in any modern web browser. The application allows users to perform various calculations efficiently and accurately, catering to both basic and advanced mathematical needs.

The project showcases the developer's proficiency in front-end web development technologies and demonstrates their ability to create functional and interactive web applications. The Scientific Calculator repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in learning about web development or looking for inspiration to build similar projects.
